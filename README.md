# Cable-Deflection-Using-Finite-Element-Method-Part-2
This project extends the cable deflection study developed in Part 1 by introducing advanced finite element concepts and numerical integration techniques. The objective is to develop a generic FEM application capable of solving the problem for an arbitrary number of elements.
